# About

ChainTrack is built with Ruby on Rails and is a pretty basic app. I developed this on Ubuntu 17.04 x64 with Ruby 2.1.4. The app uses PostgreSQL for the database and Bootstrap for the styling.

Pricing information is fetched from coinmarketcap.com and the chainblock explorer is used to lookup wallet amounts.
